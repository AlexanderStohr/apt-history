Description:
Parses dpkg log files to get package installation, removal, and rollback
information.

Ubuntu Server likes to split up the dpkg.log file and then compress the
various pieces. After seeing LinuxCommando's function, I added functionality
to pull the pieces back together. I also slightly adjusted the output to
avoid false positives.
